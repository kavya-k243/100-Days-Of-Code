Input Format: vec[]={4,7,9,10}, k = 1
Result: 1
Explanation: The missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, ……, and so on. Since 'k' is 1, the first missing element is 1.
Example 2:
Input Format: vec[]={4,7,9,10}, k = 4
Result: 5
Explanation: The missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, ……, and so on. Since 'k' is 4, the fourth missing element is 5.
